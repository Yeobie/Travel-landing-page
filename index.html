            <div><h3>Tokyo offers tradition and innovation, and unlimited opportunities to eat, shop and explore</h3>
        <p>Tokyo is located on Tokyo Bay in the Kanto region of Honshu, Japan‚Äôs largest island. Tokyo is known for its fashion and shopping, from the trendy shopping districts of Harajuku and Shibuya, to the luxury flagships of Ginza.

Shinjuku is the thriving business district; a mix of gleaming skyscrapers and atmospheric back streets with tiny bars. Asakusa is the heart of Tokyo‚Äôs downtown, with ancient temples and traditional stores. Tokyo is a foodie paradise with more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city in the world, along with hundreds of cheap and delicious ramen shops.</p>

<h3>Ikebukuro</h3>
<p>Ikebukuro is a leading shopping and entertainment area in Tokyo. It is very popular for its shopping malls, live music venues, and anime-inspired facilities but you can also find lesser known quiet shrines and excellent dining places!</p>

<h5>Worth visiting</h5>
<p>Milky Way Caf√©.  It's a star-themed caf√©. The restaurant itself looks like a colorful diner with small star details spread all over the furniture. Every ice-cream has the name of an astrological sign.</p>

<h3>Harajuku</h3>
<p>It is the center of Japan's most extreme teenage cultures and fashion styles.

The focal point is Takeshita Dori and its side streets, which are lined by many trendy shops, fashion boutiques, used clothes stores, and crepe stands.</p>

<h5>Worth visiting</h5>
<p> Meiji Jingu, one of Tokyo's major shrines, is located just west of the railway tracks in a large green oasis shared with the spacious Yoyogi Park.</p>

<img src="../Images/Asakusa.jpg" alt="asakusa">

<h3>Asakusa</h3>
<p>Here, the atmosphere of the Tokyo of past decades survives.

The main attraction is Sensoji, a very popular Buddhist temple. The temple is approached via the Nakamise, a shopping street that has been providing temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and tourist souvenirs for centuries. </p>

<h5>Worth visiting</h5>
<p>There are a handful of unagi-ya (freshwater eel restaurants) in the area. Unagi, or freshwater eel, is relatively expensive with prices starting at 2000 yen.</p>
